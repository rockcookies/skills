# Clash Verge Diagnostics

Inspect Clash Verge or mihomo, manage profile-specific routing, and diagnose connectivity.

## Routing

- Confirm the target profile, constraints, requested access path, and done-when signal.
- Load `references/full-guide.md` for commands, templates, and diagnosis matrices.
- Load `references/local-hub.md` before `hub`, `align`, `roles`, `clone`, `setup-ai`, or `switch`, and whenever the user says a previous sync did not apply.
- Keep the change limited to the requested target.

## Safety

- Diagnose and align are read-only. Writes require a shown summary and explicit confirmation.
- Edit enhancement overlays or the confirmed local-hub YAML. Do not edit raw subscription dumps.
- `tun.route-exclude-address` is union-only. `DIRECT` is not a TUN bypass.
- Never invent or print node IPs, credentials, subscription UIDs, or machine hostnames.
- After an overlay or hub-YAML write, quit and reopen Clash Verge. `PUT /configs` does not re-merge overlays.

## Modes

| Argument | Mode |
|---|---|
| empty or a hostname | diagnose |
| `profiles` / `list` / `ls` | list local and remote profiles |
| `status` | live kernel, TUN, and selected nodes |
| `hub` / `roles` | local-hub topology |
| `align` / `sync-check` | read-only multi-machine comparison |
| `switch-check` / `health` | pre-switch health |
| `clone` / `setup-ai` / `switch` | confirmed profile writes |
| `rustdesk` / `bypass` | TUN exclusion for a relay IP |

Resolve the named target before `setup-ai`. Apply airport-style enhancement overlays only when that target is `type: remote`; edit the named hub YAML when it is `type: local`.

## Verify

- Parse the target YAML after every write.
- Query mihomo by trying both Unix sockets and then the configured HTTP controller; fall back on request failure, not socket existence alone.
- For routes, `chains[-1]` is the matched group and `chains[0]` is the dialed node.
- Report files changed, commands run, evidence, and remaining risk.
